##Requirements, Stretch goals and review
#Requirements

- 🎯 Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).
- 🎯 Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned).
- 🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
- 🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.
  #Stretch Goals
- 🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
- 🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
- 🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.
  #Review
- achieved all base requirements and most of the stretch goals
- didn't investigate srcset, so haven't used it, but it could've helped, as my images are mostly vertical, so get distorted on a desktop
- nothing was particularly difficult, just required googling to understand what to use to target as an event for key presses
- are there any ways i could improve on my functions? also is my way of handling image storage less efficient?
- mostly just MDN
- one error i encountered was the left movement not working, it took me far too long to realise it was because i had pasted the code for the click on the button and not changed the called function
- creation of the website went very well, but i could've picked better images due to most being mobile sized and stretching awkwardly on desktop
