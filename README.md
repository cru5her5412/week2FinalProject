##Requirements, Stretch goals and review
#Requirements
-🎯 Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).
-🎯 Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned).
-🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
-🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.
#Stretch Goals
-🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
-🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
-🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.
